# wolf_sheep_simulation

A small simulator of prey-predator relationship using agents.

Written in collaboration with _M. Luca Pinguet_.


The __model.py__ contains the code to launch which build a tKinter window and simulate the evolution in population of two species : wolf and sheep.

The __presentation.pdf__ file is the same exercice but from a mathematical point of vue.
